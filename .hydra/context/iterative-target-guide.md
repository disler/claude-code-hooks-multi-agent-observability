# ðŸŽ¯ Iterative Target System Guide

## Overview

The Iterative Target System enhances Hydra agent briefings with clear, measurable targets that agents can iterate against. This system follows the principle that "Claude performs best when it has a clear target to iterate against" by providing structured success criteria for complex tasks.

## How It Works

### Automatic Inclusion
The system automatically includes iteration targets based on task characteristics:

- **Implementation tasks**: Create, build, develop, implement, design
- **Enhancement tasks**: Refactor, enhance, optimize, improve  
- **Validation tasks**: Test, QA, validate, verify

### Agent-Specific Targets
Each agent type gets specialized target templates:

- **Backend**: API specs, database schemas, performance requirements
- **Frontend**: Visual references, component requirements, browser compatibility
- **Testing**: Coverage goals, test scenarios, quality gates
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure specs, deployment pipelines, monitoring
- **VCS**: Branch strategies, commit standards, release processes
- **Task History**: Analysis scope, pattern recognition, reporting needs

## Target Structure

### Core Components

```markdown
### ðŸŽ¯ ITERATION_TARGET
**Visual Reference**: [Mockups, specs, or documentation links]
**Test Cases**:
- Input: [Specific test scenarios]
- Expected Output: [Measurable success criteria]
- Acceptance Criteria: [Clear, testable requirements]

**Iteration Context**:
- Previous Attempts: [Summary of failed attempts]
- Known Constraints: [Technical or business limitations]
- Success Metrics: [How to measure completion]
```

### Agent-Specific Sections

#### Backend Agents
- **API Specification**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- **Database Schema**: Tables, migrations, constraints
- **Performance Requirements**: Response times, throughput

#### Frontend Agents  
- **Visual Reference**: Design files, wireframes
- **Component Requirements**: Layout, styling, interactions
- **Browser Compatibility**: Target browsers, features, performance

#### Testing Agents
- **Test Coverage Goals**: Coverage percentages by type
- **Test Scenarios**: Unit, integration, E2E scenarios
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage thresholds, performance limits

## Usage Examples

### Backend API Development
```markdown
### ðŸŽ¯ ITERATION_TARGET
**API Specification**: `/docs/api/user-management.yaml`
**Test Cases**:
- Request: `POST /api/users` with valid JSON payload
- Response: `201 Created` with user ID and timestamps
- Performance: < 200ms response time, handle 1000 req/min

**Database Schema**:
- Tables: `users`, `user_profiles`, `user_sessions`
- Migrations: Add email_verified column, create indexes
- Constraints: Unique email, password min 8 chars

**Iteration Context**:
- Previous Attempts: JWT implementation had token expiry issues
- Technical Constraints: PostgreSQL 13, FastAPI 0.68+
- Success Metrics: All tests pass, OpenAPI spec validates
```

### Frontend Component Development
```markdown
### ðŸŽ¯ ITERATION_TARGET
**Visual Reference**: `/designs/dashboard-layout.figma`
**Components**:
- Layout: Responsive grid with sidebar navigation
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, dark/light theme support
- Interactions: Smooth animations, keyboard navigation

**Browser Compatibility**:
- Targets: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+
- Features: CSS Grid, Intersection Observer API
- Performance: < 100ms initial render, 95+ Lighthouse score

**Iteration Context**:
- Previous Attempts: Mobile layout broke on iOS Safari
- Design Constraints: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- Success Metrics: Cross-browser testing passes, accessible
```

### Testing Implementation
```markdown
### ðŸŽ¯ ITERATION_TARGET
**Test Coverage Goals**: 90% line coverage, 85% branch coverage
**Test Scenarios**:
- Unit Tests: All utility functions, API endpoints, React hooks
- Integration Tests: Database operations, external API calls
- Edge Cases: Error handling, boundary conditions, null values

**Quality Gates**:
- Coverage: Jest reports meet thresholds
- Performance: Test suite runs in < 30 seconds
- Reliability: Zero flaky tests, deterministic results

**Iteration Context**:
- Previous Test Failures: Async tests with race conditions
- Testing Constraints: CI/CD pipeline timeout at 5 minutes
- Success Metrics: All tests pass, coverage gates enforced
```

## Configuration

### Project-Specific Targets
Edit `.hydra/context/agent-minimal-context.md` to customize targets for your project:

1. **Replace TODO placeholders** with actual project context
2. **Update target templates** with specific requirements
3. **Add visual references** with actual file paths
4. **Define success metrics** relevant to your project

### Template Customization
Modify `/opt/hydra/templates/context/agent-minimal-context.md` to change default target structures for new projects.

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Targets

1. **Be Specific**: Use concrete numbers, file paths, and measurable criteria
2. **Include Context**: Mention previous attempts and known constraints
3. **Visual References**: Always include mockups, specs, or documentation links
4. **Test Cases**: Provide specific inputs and expected outputs
5. **Success Metrics**: Define clear completion criteria

### Target Maintenance

1. **Update Regularly**: Keep targets current with project evolution
2. **Learn from Failures**: Document failed approaches in "Previous Attempts"
3. **Track Success**: Monitor which target styles work best for your team
4. **Iterate Targets**: Improve target quality based on agent performance

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Backward Compatibility
- Targets are only included for complex implementation tasks
- Simple tasks (debugging, minor fixes) don't get targets to avoid overhead
- Existing projects without targets continue to work normally

### Context Size Management
- Targets add ~200-500 tokens per agent briefing
- Only included when task complexity warrants iteration guidance
- Works with existing context monitoring and size limits

### Agent Classification
- Targets are extracted based on detected agent type
- Custom agent types inherit general target structure
- Specialized agents get type-specific target templates

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Target Effectiveness
Monitor these metrics to assess target system effectiveness:

- **Task Success Rate**: Compare completion rates with/without targets
- **Iteration Count**: Track how many attempts tasks require
- **Context Utilization**: Measure how often targets are referenced
- **Agent Performance**: Assess quality improvements with clear targets

### Logging
Target usage is logged in `.hydra/logs/context-usage.log` with additional metadata:
- Whether targets were included
- Target extraction time
- Target content length
- Task completion status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Targets Not Appearing**: Check task description matches inclusion criteria
2. **Wrong Target Type**: Verify agent classification is correct
3. **Empty Targets**: Ensure template contains target sections for agent type
4. **Context Overflow**: Targets might push context over size limits

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if targets would be included
bash /opt/hydra/core/hooks/inject-agent-briefing.sh "Implement user login" "Create authentication system"

# Verify target extraction
grep -A 20 "ITERATION_TARGET" .hydra/context/agent-minimal-context.md

# Monitor context size with targets
hydra-context-monitor --include-targets
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Visual Target Validation**: OCR comparison with actual implementation
- **Target Version Control**: Track target evolution over time
- **Success Pattern Learning**: Automatically improve targets based on outcomes
- **Multi-Modal Targets**: Support for video, audio, and interactive references

### Extension Points
- Custom target extractors for specialized agent types
- Target template inheritance and composition
- Integration with external design tools and specifications
- Automated target generation from requirements documents

This system transforms Hydra from providing general context to delivering precise, actionable targets that agents can systematically work towards, dramatically improving task success rates and reducing iteration cycles.
