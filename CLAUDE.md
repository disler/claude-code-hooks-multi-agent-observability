# üéØ Claude Code Environment

> **AUTOMATIC ACTIVATION**: This file is automatically loaded by Claude Code CLI when launched in this directory.

## üñ•Ô∏è System Environment

**Platform**: Debian Linux (Terminal Server)
**Tool**: Claude Code CLI
**Command**: `claude` (terminal application)
**Model**: Claude by Anthropic (LLM)
**Date**: See `<env>` tag in system context
**Working Directory**: See `<env>` tag in system context

### System Details
- **OS**: Debian-based Linux server
- **Access**: Terminal/CLI only (no GUI)
- **User**: Standard Linux user with sudo access when needed
- **Shell**: Bash

## ü§ñ Core Identity

You are **Claude** - an AI assistant running in Claude Code CLI. Your specific role (orchestrator, specialized agent, or general assistant) will be determined by the context of your invocation.

## üìã Operating Guidelines

1. **Focus on the assigned task** - Complete what was requested efficiently
2. **Use available tools** - Leverage all tools at your disposal
3. **Follow language conventions**:
   - Czech for user communication
   - English for code, comments, documentation, and git operations
4. **Respect system boundaries** - Work within assigned directories and permissions
5. **Maintain quality** - Ensure all work meets professional standards

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

Claude Code CLI provides access to:
- **File Operations**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep
- **System**: Bash (command execution), LS
- **Search**: Task (for complex multi-file searches)
- **Development**: mcp__ide__getDiagnostics, mcp__ide__executeCode
- **Web**: WebSearch, WebFetch
- **Automation**: Playwright (mcp__playwright__*)
- **AI Enhancement**: mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking
- **Version Control**: GitHub integration (mcp__github__*)
- **Documentation**: Context7 MCP for library docs:
  - `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` - Find library ID by name
  - `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Fetch documentation with optional topic filter
- **Organization**: TodoWrite for task management

## üêç Hydra System Context

This environment includes the **Hydra multi-agent orchestration system**:
- **Location**: `/opt/hydra/` directory (global installation)
- **Purpose**: Parallel task execution via specialized agents
- **Multi-project**: Supports multiple projects with dedicated contexts
- **Hooks**: Automated context injection and validation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking

### Hydra Components
- `/opt/hydra/core/` - Core orchestration components
- `/opt/hydra/templates/` - Templates for new projects
- `/opt/hydra/bin/` - CLI tools and utilities
- Local `.hydra/` - Project-specific configurations
  - `.hydra/context/` - Project context files
  - `.hydra/playbooks/` - Project playbooks

## üìù Execution Context

Your execution context depends on how you were invoked:
1. **Direct invocation** - General assistant mode
2. **Task tool** - Specialized agent with injected briefing
3. **Orchestrator mode** - When launched from project root with orchestrator instructions
4. **Project mode** - When executed with specific project configuration

### Project Context Detection

Hydra automatically detects project context through:
1. **Local `.hydra/` directory** (searched upward from current directory)
2. **Template-based creation** - New projects initialized from templates

When local project context is detected, agents automatically load:
- Project-specific context from `.hydra/context/`
- Project-specific playbooks from `.hydra/playbooks/`
- Project configuration from `.hydra/config.json`

## ‚ö° Performance Notes

- **Context window**: Monitor token usage, especially in long sessions
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple agents may run simultaneously
- **Stateless agents**: Task agents don't share conversation history
- **Tool efficiency**: Batch operations when possible

## üîß Best Practices

1. **Tool selection** - Choose the right tool for each task
2. **Error handling** - Report issues with full context
3. **Code conventions** - Follow project-specific patterns
4. **Documentation** - Update only when necessary
5. **Security** - Never expose credentials or sensitive data

## üìñ Documentation Search Tips

### Using Context7 for External Libraries
```bash
# Example: Find Next.js documentation
1. mcp__context7__resolve-library-id with "next.js"
2. mcp__context7__get-library-docs with "/vercel/next.js" and topic "routing"
```

### Common Library IDs
- `/vercel/next.js` - Next.js framework
- `/supabase/supabase` - Supabase backend
- `/mongodb/docs` - MongoDB database
- `/upstash/context7` - Context7 documentation
